It was built for regression testing, but it can also serve as an introduction to REDCap's features.

Regression testing is a set of tests that ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change. If something was functional and is found no longer functional, that is a regression.  To perform a regression test simply follow the order of the instruments and the directions within each instrument.  One instrument will check one aspect of REDCap and may involve a single test or multiple tests.  When a test passes, mark the instrument as ""Complete"" (Green).  When a test fails mark it ""Incomplete"" (Red) if it is a critical failure.  Mark it as ""Unverified"" (Yellow) if it fails but is not mission critical.  When another test is needed, another time point must be added to the event grid and instruments assigned to that event.

To use this as an introduction to REDCap follow the instruments in order, as if you are regression testing.  Mark the instrument as ""Complete"" (Green) when you are proficient.  Mark it ""Incomplete"" (Red) to revisit the topic.  Mark it ""Unverified"" (Yellow) if there are questions about the content, but no follow up is needed.

All links open in a new tab.  When done with that tab, close it.

Check open_basedir in php . ini. If defined it limits PHP read/write rights to specified path and its subdirectories. Ensure that upload_tmp_dir is inside this path.

Check post_max_size in php . ini. If you want to upload 20 Mbyte files, try something a little bigger, like post_max_size = 21M. This defines largest size of POST message which you are probably using during upload.

The second parameter represents the offset number amount that should be added or subtracted. It can be a decimal number or integer. Tip: To subtract (i.e., go backwards in time), use a negative number. The third parameter represents the units of the offset amount, which will be represented by the following options: 'y' (years, 1 year = 365.2425 days), 'M' (months, 1 month = 30.44 days), 'd' (days), 'h' (hours), 'm' (minutes), 's' (seconds). The unit option must be wrapped in quotes or apostrophes. NOTE: Both the source field and the result field must be a text field with date, datetime, or datetime_seconds validation.

If you wish to manually set the width and/or height of the image/PDF, you may put the width/height values inside parentheses after the action tag in the following manner: @INLINE(width) or @INLINE(width,height). The width/height can be a percentage value (e.g., 50%) or a number representing size in pixels (e.g., 400). Thus @INLINE(50%) will display an image at 50% size for the area in which it is contained on the page, and @INLINE(400,100) would display the image always at 400px tall and 100px wide. To make an inline PDF appear taller on the page, you might use @INLINE(100%,600) since 300px is the default height for inline PDFs.

at_setvalue_help,action_tags,,descriptive,"@SETVALUE:  Sets a field's value to static text or dynamic/piped text whenever a data entry form or survey page is loaded, in which it will always overwrite an existing value of the field. The format must follow the pattern @SETVALUE=""????"", in which the desired value should be inside single or double quotes. For text fields, you may pipe and concatenate values from other fields in the project - e.g., @SETVALUE='Name: [first_name] [last_name], DOB: [dob]'. For checkbox fields, simply separate multiple checkbox values with commas - e.g., @SETVALUE='1,3,[other_field:value]'. NOTE: The piped value does *not* get applied during any data imports (via API or Data Import Tool) but only operates when viewing survey pages and data entry forms. NOTE: A field with @SETVALUE will have its value updated ONLY when the page loads, which means that its value will not be updated in real-time if you modify other fields on the same page that are piped into the @SETVALUE tag. NOTE: If being used on a date or datetime field, the date value inside the quotes must be in Y-M-D format - e.g., @SETVALUE='2007-12-25' - regardless of the field's set date format. NOTE: The only difference between @SETVALUE and @DEFAULT is that @DEFAULT is only applied when an instrument has no data yet, whereas @SETVALUE will always be applied on an instrument, meaning that @SETVALUE will ALWAYS overwrite the value if a field value already exists. TIP: To pipe the value of one multiple choice field into another multiple choice field, make sure you append ':value' to the variable being piped - e.g., @SETVALUE='[my_dropdown:value]'. (In earlier versions of REDCap, the @SETVALUE action tag went by the name @PREFILL, which still works equivalently to @SETVALUE for backward compatibility purposes.)",,,,,,,"[action_tag_help] = 1",,,,,,
